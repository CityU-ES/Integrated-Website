Many young Hong Kong managers may realize that their undergraduate studies have not sufficiently prepared them in one particular area to meet the challenge of today's complex managerial problems present: analytical rigor. The Master of Science in Business and Data Analytics (MScBDA) program has been developed to provide the modern quantitative skills that will facilitate problem identification, formulation, and analysis at all levels of management in the business, industry, and public sectors.

As Hong Kong enters into a new era of development, personnel with analytical skills will play an increasingly important role in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of rapidly expanding service organizations. The MScBDA program offers a comprehensive coverage of quantitative methods (including courses on data mining, marketing research, financial modeling and risk management) and adopts the point of view of business intelligence, drawing on the practical experience and knowledge in the fields. The program benefits from the use of relevant software packages to reinforce the student's understanding of the concepts, methods, and processes introduced.

**Potential students of the program are the graduates of:**

*   accounting, economics and finance;
*   business, management, marketing and administration;
*   computer science and mathematics;
*   engineering;
and whose career path has led them in the direction where quantitative analysis has a significant role. Preference will be given to local Hong Kong applicants.

The MScBDA program is unique in Hong Kong in that it offers many graduates of Hong Kong tertiary institutions an opportunity to enhance their analytical skills and become more effective decision makers in their organizations. Many of our graduates are holding managerial positions in business and industrial sectors.
