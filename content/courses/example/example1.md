# Programme Structure
---
The program is composed of "courses". Each course is assigned a number of credit units (CU) - usually three units for a one semester course. Each course is thirteen weeks long. Assessment is carried out on the basis of assignments, tests, projects and examinations.

Students have the flexibility of integrating the courses in a variety of ways. Variations of studying schedules may be devised to cater for individual requirements.
